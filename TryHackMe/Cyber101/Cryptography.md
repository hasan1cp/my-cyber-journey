## 📘 Key Concepts Learned

- What is Cryptography (Confidentiality, Integrity, Authentication)
- Encryption vs Encoding vs Hashing
- Caesar Cipher, ROT13, XOR, Vigenère
- Hash algorithms: MD5, SHA1, SHA256
- Tools: CyberChef, `hashcat`, `openssl`, `gpg`

## 🛠️ Commands and Tools

| Tool/Command     | Description                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `openssl`        | Generate RSA keys, encrypt/decrypt   |
| `gpg`            | Encrypt files or messages            |
| `md5sum`, `sha256sum` | Calculate hashes on Linux      |

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Hashing is one-way; encryption is reversible.
- Caesar and ROT13 are substitution ciphers.
- Brute-forcing weak algorithms like Caesar is easy using frequency analysis.
- Learned to recognize encoding patterns (Base64, Hex).

---

## ❗ Challenges Faced

- Confused hashing vs encryption at first.
- Got stuck brute-forcing Vigenère before noticing key hint.

## ✅ Final Thoughts

This room gave me the foundational understanding I need for real-world cryptographic analysis, password cracking, and CTFs. Tools like CyberChef make crypto challenges faster to solve.
